Here's some useful materials for access to audio, sound, etc.:

py.zip is a zip with 3 source files for using sounddevice library to access audio ports in python.

play_sine.py plays a sine wave of arbitrary frequency on your selected device.

plot_input.py plots the input to the microphone on a matplotlib window, i.e. a waveform plotter for your microphone.

demo.py is a file for combining the two above functions together.

MATLAB has a Simulink implementation here:

Materials from previous years:

Rotary SWIMulator (SWIM simulator in polar coordinates), "single_polar_view.py" could be modified to do lab 5.
It receives audio from the microphone and plots it in a circular plot.
Modify the number of plotted points so that an incoming signal is stationary on the SWIMulator.
You can do this by matching the plotted points to be a multiple of the period of an incoming signal.
Once it's stationary you should see the whole plot rotate when you move the phone back and forth.
You could do this with only a little bit of modification of "single_polar_view.py"

One of the students did a smartphone version of the lab:
AndroidSWIM-master.zip
